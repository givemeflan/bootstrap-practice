# bootstrap-practice
This repository will hold projects where I practice Bootstrap, reset.css, Grid, and other frameworks.

## The Project List
- Faux Mock Newspaper Front page (faux-paper.html)


### Faux Mock Newspaper Front Page
For this mini project or exercise, I used Bootstrap. I thought the framework was perfect for making an "old school" inspired newspaper type layout. I guess like I like the color orange lately! For those who are curious, I named my faux newspaper The Daily Cheese because cheese is a source of getting calcium daily just like how you can read the news daily! I know, corny :innocent: The headlines are relevant to the times, have to keep it real.
